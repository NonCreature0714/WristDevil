<p>This open source project was started in August of 2016 as an educational venture in sensors, coding, iterative design, and microprocessors.  All Austin Community College students, staff, and faculty are welcome to join the <a href="http://researchguides.austincc.edu/makerspace">Batlab Makerspace</a>, and, of course, all others are welcome to use/reuse the code.</p>

<a id="vision" class="anchor" href="#vision" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vision</h3>

<p>To empower persons with sight impairment. To help them live a fuller life, and to have fun building it for them. To create a thing which is durable, comfortable, smart, and practical.</p>

<p>After a binge session of DareDevil on Netflix, Bill thought it would be cool to make something which empowered persons with sight impairment. Meason and Stephen immediately recognized it as a good idea, and helped the idea come to fruition. </p>

<p>The team didn't have much to start with - just a couple of ultrasonic sensors, an Arduino Uno, and a Raspberry Pi. But it worked! <img src="http://i.imgur.com/t4JFpQL.jpg" alt="A sensor in early prototype stage, with just an LED as feedback."></p>

<p>A haptic sensor has since been added, <img src="http://i.imgur.com/CuMiFY1.jpg" alt="Pictured is the WristDevil with it's new haptic motor attached.">, and the first design iteration of the wrist housing is being fabricated.</p>
